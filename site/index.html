        <p id="content">Maybe I'm not ready
I almost got caught everyday
Running away, further away
To that place where there is no you
I gotta free me, further away from you
The further I go the closer I get to no worries
Nobody can't stop me I let you go fearlessly
Gotta free me, no worries</p>

        <p id="content">Even a fool knows this
You're the best thing I've got
Once again towards you One more step, I will never stop
I shouldn't turn away
I know it because I'm a fool
I can't live without you
Once again towards you One more step, I will never stop
I'll always be on track.</p>

        <p id="content">I want you to notice how I am feeling
As if you would notice that I was lying
I don't want to just be around you like the scent

I thought I knew
I was so confident that I knew everything
But I didn't know, with you
As I get close to you, it gets more complicated
Even when I have something to say, my head goes blank
At the end of the day, I'm saying just meaningless words</p>
